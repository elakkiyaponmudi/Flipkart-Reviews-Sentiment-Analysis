Flipkart Product Reviews Analysis and Recommendation System
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an automated system for collecting and analyzing product reviews from Flipkart. By leveraging web scraping techniques and sentiment analysis, the project aims to generate data-driven product recommendations. The project involves the following key tasks:

Web Scraping: Extract product reviews from Flipkart, focusing on various product categories such as electronics, clothing, and home appliances.
Data Cleaning and Structuring: Process and structure the scraped data to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
Sentiment Analysis: Determine the overall customer sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) for each product based on the collected reviews.
Product Recommendation: Recommend top products in each category using the results of the sentiment analysis.
Visualization and Reporting: Create visual representations of the data and compile a comprehensive report detailing the analysis process, findings, and recommendations.
Business Use Cases
E-commerce Platforms: Enhance product recommendation engines by incorporating sentiment analysis of customer reviews.
Market Research Firms: Analyze consumer sentiment towards various products to inform business strategies.
Retail Companies: Monitor customer feedback to improve product offerings and customer satisfaction.
Business Intelligence Tools: Integrate with dashboards to provide real-time insights on product performance based on customer reviews.
